<h1 class="major">AnimationPhysics.org - Understanding Physics for Animators</h1>
Physics! It's super important as an animator to understand even the most basic laws of physics. I'm not suggesting you need to become a physicist, but really understanding what is physically possible and what isn't can help improve believability and separate "ok" animation with amazing animation. 

I found this site years ago and it still appears to be online so I thought I would share it here. The site was created by Alejandro Garcia, a physicist and professor at San Jose State University. He consults for Dreamworks Animation and created this course to help artists really understand the laws of the physical world to help improve the craft of animation.

At the end of the day, these laws can be broken in animation but if you try to include them in your work, it'll be on that much more believable.
