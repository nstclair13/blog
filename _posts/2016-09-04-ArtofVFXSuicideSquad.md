Working on Suicide Squad was probably one of my most enjoyable shows I've been a part of. Mainly due to the people I got the privilege to work with, but also because the show was generally a fun one to animate on.

**[Mark Breakspear](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0106421/)**, whom the article is with, was an awesome VFX supervisor to work with and always made an effort to appreciate the crew while being funny and entertaining day in and day out. My animation supervisor, **[Steve Nichols](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629733/)**, and Animation Lead, **[Richard Smith](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2242449/)**, were also two of the best that I've ever gotten to work with. I learned a ton on this show and hopefully the fans enjoyed the work.
