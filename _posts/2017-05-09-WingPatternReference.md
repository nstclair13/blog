<h1 class="major">Flying Creature Reference</h1>
This image is an old one as I recall seeing it make the rounds online awhile ago. It's a very informative study, especially for those of you working on flying creatures. While the timing would change based on the size of the creature, the overall idea and concepts presented here can really translate well onto a variety of characters.
