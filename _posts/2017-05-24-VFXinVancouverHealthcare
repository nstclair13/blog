Ahhh healthcare. One of the most significant differences between the United States and Canada. As most of you reading this probably already knows, it's done a lot differently up in Canada. There are many similarities and differences, plus some common misconceptions I think are worth discussing. In reality, it's an important topic and can be a big consideration if thinking of relocating. This post is mostly for US Residents coming up North and not necessarily for other Canadians moving across provinces.

So let's dive in, yeah?

## Overview
First and foremost, healthcare in Canada is universal and called a single payer system. That means there's only one place you get insurance from - the Government- and everyone is eligible with the same premium costs per month, per person. In British Columbia specifically, healthcare is also known as [MSP or Medical Services Plan](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/msp). One thing to note is that MSP does not cover all aspects of your health. Just like in the State, Dental, Vision, and other specialty type of stuff is not covered. That said, it's a really important and a great idea to get a supplemental plan that covers all the things not covered by MSP. Companies like [Manulife](https://www.manulife.ca/for-you.html) offer great plans that are pretty comprehensive and affordable. It should also be noted that MSP does NOT cover much, if anything, when traveling outside of Canada - so if you are going back and forth between the States and Canada often, it's worth picking up additional coverage that has a travel component. If you are lucky, the company you work for will offer something along these lines.

## Eligibility 
Eligibility for healthcare in Canada is vastly different than the States. The main requirements in BC are you need to live here. Ok, it's a bit more than that but it doesn't have a million loopholes and technicailities like most Insurances in the States do.

In order to obtain MSP coverage, you need to have these requirements:
* must be a citizen of Canada or be lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence;
* must make his or her home in B.C.; and
* must be physically present in B.C. at least six months in a calendar year, or a shorter prescribed period.*

<sub>*Eligible B.C. residents (citizens of Canada or persons who are lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence) who are outside B.C. for vacation purposes only, are allowed a total absence of up to seven months in a calendar year.</sub>

A more detailed description, including where the above was taken from, can be read **[here](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/msp/bc-residents/eligibility-and-enrolment/are-you-eligible)**

## Cost
This is where the biggest differences between the States and Canada come in. The **[Premium Cost](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/msp/bc-residents/premiums/rates)** in Vancouver/BC is incredibly, incredibly cheap versus any insurance plan I have seen in the States.
