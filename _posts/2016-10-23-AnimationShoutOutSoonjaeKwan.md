Every now and then I come across an exceptional demo reel or piece of animation that I think deserves a shout out. This time I'd like to share a link to the work of **[Soonjae Kwan](https://vimeo.com/167209402)**. I really enjoyed the creature work on his reel, especially the griffon shot and the lion chasing the guy on the motorcycle. Nice work!

Here's a link to **[more of his work](https://vimeo.com/skwon)**.

Check it out!
