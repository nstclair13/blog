Now, before you read on let me start with one caveat - I'm not a coder or web developer by any stretch of the word. Some of the things I mention below might be extremely rudimentary to you or maybe there are better solutions, but if you are at all interested in learning to build your own website then some of these just might help you along the way.  


I enjoy tinkering around and learning stuff through trial and error. There, I said it. I feel that there is something very valuable about learning how things work by just diving into the deep end of a subject and thrashing your way to the surface. Yeah, it's difficult, and yes, it can be near impossible sometimes but it's much more satisfying when you finally get an "Aha!" moment.  Perhaps I enjoy this way the most because that is how I generally approached learning animation and most of the artistic topics I've learned during my career.  You're probably thinking that I could have just used a website builder like Wix.com or Squarespace; Both of these (plus many other platforms) offer great utility, time savings, and bang for your buck; especially for non-coders. My response? - Where's the fun in that? I would also say that you can get up and running pretty quickly if you know just the basics of HTML while saving a lot of money along the way PLUS maintaining complete control over your site.  

Ok, with that out of the way, I'm assuming you are still interested. Read on!

This very website costs me literally $12 a year to maintain. $1 a month. That's it.  I have complete control over the site from literally any web browser, it's fast and responsive, secure, and fairly well designed if I do say so myself. (I honestly can't take the credit for 99.99% of the design but more on that below)

So how do I have this site for only 12 bucks a year? You only need three things:  

-a web domain purchased through **[Google Domains](https://domains.google/#/)** ($12 - there it is)  
-a **[GitHub account](https://github.com/)** (free!)  
-a **[website design template](https://html5up.net/)** (free!)  

That's it.  



## **[Chrome Right Click Inspect]**  
See something online you want to replicate? This helps you dissect what's going on. It's also a great diagnostic tool for your own work too. 

## **[Brackets](http://brackets.io/)**  

A coding application. It has syntax highlighting, live site previews, all kind of helpful workflow stuff. It changed the way I approached coding. Can't recommend it enough!  

## **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**  
This site was extremely foreign to me as a non developed/coder. GitHub is basically a huge open source sharing/hosting website where anyone can host websites and code and anyone can also see the source code. Many, many useful tools have come from here such as 

There are a lot of tutorials and YouTube channels online that can help get you up and running. I found **[this channel from Thomas Bradley](https://www.youtube.com/user/acinteractivedesign/videos)** to be well done and easy to understand from a novice perspective.  


## **[HTML5up.net](https://html5up.net/)**


## **[SVG Generator on Github](http://www.svgeneration.com/recipes/GPlay/)**  
Awesome tool to create and edit .SVG texture backgrounds. I use one on my websites main page. SVG is a vector format that scales perfectly versus regular bitmap images and it's super light on file size. 


## **[Lity](http://sorgalla.com/lity/)**  
Super minimal lightbox for all kinds of content. One simple CSS and JS file to link, then just add three words of code to whatever you are putting in a light of. Handles images, video, inline content, all sorts of stuff!

## **[Formspree](https://formspree.io/)**  
Making a contact form for a static site? This is the tool you need. Since PHP isn't something that can be used on a static site such as a Jekyll blog or simple HTML5 site, this is going to be a prime candidate to get that contact form working as you want it to. 


## **[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)**  
A free content delivery network. 


## **[Webmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)**  
This is a website that helps optimize your site and improve its loading speed and overall functionality. It's free to use, just type in your website's address, wait a few moments, and it'll spit out a couple of reports indicating all the ways your website is being slowed down and where it is working nicely! 

## **[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)**  
Probably the best site online to visit when you are having trouble figuring out a piece of code. It's filled to the brim with amazing people that often give multiple correct ways of tackling a difficult subject.
