<h1 class="major">What I'm Working on - Kingsman: The Golden Circle</h1>
Just a quick update today to say what I'm working on at work. I obviously cant say anything until it's released in 2017 but here is an official poster for the time being! Being a fan of the first film, getting to work on the sequel is pretty exciting! It's going to be a fun one and I cannot wait until it comes out for people to see the work being done.
