Hello and welcome! My name is Nicholas St. Clair, I'm an animator currently working in the VFX industry. I've been doing this professionally for awhile now and decided to make this blog to talk about some of my experiences and interests. If you're so inclined, you can see my experience **[here](https://www.nick-st-clair.com/#one)**. You can also check out some of my work **[here](https://www.nick-st-clair.com/professional)** and **[here](https://www.nick-st-clair.com/personal).**

So you're probably thinking, "Ugh, another animation blog where it's the same ole thing... "This is how a walk cycle should be done!" or "Read this, I have insight into how to make a character think and come alive!", "Best Demo Reel Tips!" etc etc.. Well, this isn't that blog. Sure, from time to time I will talk about the finer points of animation, what I'm working on, and some of the great things I've learned along the way, however, there are a lot better animation blogs out there from much, much, MUCH more talented artists. 

The majority of this blog will be different. As the name says, this blog is about animation as an expat. Oooooh what's that? Well, I am a U.S. Citizen born and raised but I also happen to be working and living in Vancouver BC, Canada. What I've noticed over the years is that even though majority of people understand that this career (animation) must be willing to move and travel the world, no one seems to really talk about any of the specifics and realities. When I decided to move my family up here from Los Angles, I found it very hard to find resources that spoke to people in similar situations like me. Sure, I was given some great resources from my employer about the move but those only went so far. I also see questions online on various sites and forums about people in similar situations. Thus, the Animation Expat blog.  

**What you can expect:** 
I plan to share a little bit more information about my experiences as an expat working in the industry. I'll also have some interesting tech, animation and general life posts along the way. Hopefully you'll enjoy some of my rants.

So with that, stay tuned. More to follow!
