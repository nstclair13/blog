<h1 class="major">Work Update - Spider-Man: Homecoming</h1>

So it has been a little while since my last work update post. I finally wrapped up my work on Kingsman: The Golden Circle and quickly moved onto my next project, Spider-Man: Homecoming! 

Not only has being able to animate Spider-Man been a dream of mine since pursuing animation and VFX, but I was also assigned to the show as a Lead Animator! I have been incredibly fortunate to have a wonderful team of animators to work with and I have learned quite a bit about my abilities and this new role I have taken on. I wish I was able to animate more during the day, but it's been eye opening so far and I wouldn't change a thing.

Unfortunately I cannot say anything about the project, but it's shaping up to be a really, really, exciting show to be a part of.

More to come soon I hope!
