<h1 class="major">Work Update - Spider-Man: Homecoming</h1>

So it has been a little while since my last work update post. I finally wrapped up my work on Kingsman: The Golden Circle and quickly moved onto my next project, Spider-Man: Homecoming! Not only has being able to animate Spider-Man been a dream of mine since pursuing animation and VFX, but I was also assigned to the show as a Lead Animator! Unfortunately I cannot say anything about the project, but it's shaping up to be a really, really, exciting show to be a part of.

More to come soon I hope!
