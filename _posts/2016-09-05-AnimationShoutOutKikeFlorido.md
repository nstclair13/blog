<br />
Its Shout Out! Time again, and this time I’d like to share a link to the work of **[Kike Florido](https://vimeo.com/kikeflorido)**.   

This little test displayed here has so much appeal and character in it, I laugh every time I watch it. I especially love the attention to detail on the guy in the cannon. Ha! Beautiful lighting and shading work as well. Kudos all around to the peeps that worked on it!  

<br />
Go check Kike's other work and don’t forget to come back for future shout outs!
