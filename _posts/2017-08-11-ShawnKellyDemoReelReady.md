<h1 class="major">Reference&#58; Is Your Demo Reel Ready for a Major Studio with Shawn Kelly</h1>

This webinar was just posted by AnimationMentor and I wanted to share it here because I really think Shawn covered a lot of major topics worth thinking about when creating a demo reel. I've seen my fair share of reels, as well as made my own (duh), and he hit the nail on the head for almost everything discussed. 

It's a good hour+ long webcast but worth every minute you can watch. Check it out below!
