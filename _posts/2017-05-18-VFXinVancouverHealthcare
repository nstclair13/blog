Ahhh healthcare. One of the most significant differences between the United States and Canada. As most of you reading this probably already knows, it's done a lot differently up in Canada. There are many similarities and differences, plus some common misconceptions I think are worth discussing. In reality, it's an important topic and can be a big consideration if thinking of relocating.

So let's dive in, yeah?

## Overview
First and foremost, healthcare in Canada is universal and called a single payer system. That means there's only one place you get insurance from - the Government- and everyone is eligible with the same premium costs per month, per person. In British Columbia specifically, healthcare is also known as [MSP or Medical Services Plan](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/msp).
