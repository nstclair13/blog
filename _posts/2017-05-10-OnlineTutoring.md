<h1 class="major">Personalized Online Tutoring Now Available</h1>

Hey Everyone!

I've updated my website with a new section and I am now pleased to say that I am offering personalized tutoring sessions! 

You can find out more about them here: **[Personalized Online Tutoring](https://www.nick-st-clair.com/tutoring)**

I've noticed that there seems to be a general lack of any supplementary tutoring available outside the many online animation schools out there. These schools offer some amazing programs (I've attended many of them myself!) but they are fairly costly and require a big time commitment.   There are also a lot of places that provide individual critiques on your work (which I also do) but I've struggled to find any resources that are more hands on and don't require a couple months of dedicated time. 

That's where I want to help!

My goal is to offer an affordable solution for those looking to bring their work to a new level but who also may need a bit more 1-on-1 interaction during the process while not having to commit to a lengthy workshop or online course. 
Don't get me wrong - I'm not trying to compete or replace a school setting but rather I'm trying to help supplement it. Just like someone who needs a little help learning math or science, I'm trying to help within the realm of animation. 

Can't quite figure out why your shot doesn't feel right? Perhaps you need some help setting up complex constraints in Maya or some other type of technical issue? Just want to discuss career goals and need some insight? All of these and more are what I want to help with. 

Take a moment to check out my [updated site](https://www.nick-st-clair.com/tutoring) and drop me a line if you're interested!
