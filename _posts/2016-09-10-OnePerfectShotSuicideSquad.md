Here is another article about the VFX work done on Suicide Squad with **[Mark Breakspear](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0106421/)**. It was a really fun show to work on personally, and we used a lot of new techniques (to me at least) that are mentioned in this article. 
The coolest innovation we used had to be the pointcloud capture "blocking" passes we were able to show. 99% of the time it was our animation lead, **[Richard Smith](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2242449/)** doing it for us but I also did a few takes of my own as well. It wasn't a perfect system by any means but it sure allowed for a lot of iterations quickly and it did have a pretty high "cool" factor.  

After using the pointcloud software on the show I really want to setup a capture area in my office at home for my own personal use. It's fairly cheap to setup so I plan on doing another post about the setup and it's uses so check back for more on that later.
