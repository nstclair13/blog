<h1 class="major">Spiderman: Homecoming is Released!</h1>

Today is the day! Spiderman: Homecoming is finally in theaters for the world to see and it is [getting LOTS of great reviews!](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spider_man_homecoming)

I'm super proud of this one (like all the films I work on) but this one in particular is a bit more special to me. 


Lastly, here are some of the badass posters that were released for the film. You'll noticed I said some...
