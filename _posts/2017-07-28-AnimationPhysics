<h1 class="major">Physics for Animators</h1>
Physics! It's super important as an animator to understand even the most basic laws of physics. Im not suggesting you you need to be good at science or be a mathematician, but really understanding what is physically possible and what isn't can help determine performances and physical actions and separate ok animation with amazing animation. 

I found this site years ago and it still appears to be online so I thought I would share it here. 

[AnimationPhysics.org](http://animationphysics.org/)
[AnimationPhysics.org YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/AlejandroLuisGarcia/videos). 

At the end of the day, these laws can be broken in animation but if you try to include them in your work, it'll be on that much more believable.
