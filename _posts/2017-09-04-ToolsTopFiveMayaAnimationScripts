Custom Scripts. They make our animating lives so much easier. Whether it's just offsetting keys or creating custom dynamics at the click of a button, chances are you've used some sort of awesome tool to help you get by. I was thinking about what tools I have in my toolbox that I couldn't live without and thought I would share my personal favorites; maybe these will be helpful to you too! I should mention, some of these are free and others are not. While I know it's sometimes painful to purchase tools and scripts, these are really robust and well crafted tools and their creators definitely deserve some recognition and compensation for creating such helpful tools. 

So on with it then! In no specific order, these scripts and toolsets are my top 5 favorites that get just about any job done. 

## **1) aTools**  
This toolset is chock full of all types of tools for animators. It's been described as "The ultimate free utility belt for Maya animators." It was created by an amazingly talented animator named **[Alan Camilo](https://vimeo.com/user142120)** and is completely FREE.   

There are too many tools to describe in a single post, so take a gander and watch **[these](http://camiloalan.wixsite.com/atoolswebsite/help)** videos to see what is included. This set has actually become a standardized part of the tools available at Sony and I use them daily both at work and at home.  

At the time of this post, there is a new version aTools 2.0 currently being worked on.    

You can download aTools [here](http://camiloalan.wixsite.com/atoolswebsite)  


## **2) MGTools**  
This set, like aTools, has too many utilities included to name them all in a single post. While not free, it's a cheap purchase and comes with a lifetime upgrade so you never need to worry about your license expiring or needing to pay another price to get a new version. It costs about $40 USD presently. It was developed a few years before aTools became so popular by a guy named Miguel Winfield. My favorite tool is the MGAnimRecorder. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f8HWoxoX0s&feature=youtu.be&hd=1) is a video demonstrating the tool in action.    

MGTools 3 can currently be purchased [here](http://mgland.com/MGtools_en.html?url=Buy)  


## **3) QPAS Path System**  
Have a walk cycle that you want to put on a path, retime it, then bake down into world space? With this tool, it's pain free to do and saves a ton of time for complex quadraped actions.   

The script can be found here and works in any version of Maya. It costs around $65 USD. It also comes with a nice video tutorial about using the tool.

## **4) BroDynamics**  
Secondary overlap - it adds a ton to your shot but can be very tedious sometimes depending on what it being animated. This tool helps with that! With a few button clicks, you can add dynamic overlap baked right onto your controllers for almost any type of action! At Sony, we have a tool called "JFlex" which really helps get secondary motion quickly, and this is the closest thing I could find online that works in a similar fashion. You never really realize how much you use a tool until you don't have access to it. Right? In fact, BroDynamics actually goes a step further and allows for different types of dynamics to be simulated. Springs, Tails, even Rigid Body ragdolls.   

The tool can be found here and works in Maya version 2015 and beyond. It costs $30 USD and the creator, [Michael Davydov](https://gumroad.com/l/BroDynamics), is very active with it's support and troubleshooting.  


## **5) Keyframe Pro**  



**Bonus - Worthwhile Mentions!**   

6) Every year Autodesk releases a new version of Maya with new tools, user interfaces, and plug ins and each year something breaks or gets "fixed." Ok so maybe it's not that bad but often the updates between versions are hit and miss; there's usually some fantastic tools that really speed up your workflow annnnd then some that alter it arbitrarily or sometimes even hinder it. It can be hard to keep up in all honesty.  

One thing some of you might not realize is that there is also another toolset that gets updated every year - **the Maya Bonus Tools kit**.  

 Again, sometimes it's hit or miss but perhaps there's something for you this year? Best of all is the toolkit is **FREE!**  

The two bonus features I found this year that were most useful for myself are the **Dynamic Joiny Chain** and **UV Editor Tool*  

I won't go into all of the details of everything , that's Autodesk's job and frankly, they're better at it. I do suggest you check out the toolset though!

**7) bhGhost and other Brian Horgan scripts -** - While I personally don't utilize too many of his tools, I can't help but list them here for there ingenuity and power. Brian is a fantastic scripter/td and animator and makes some of the best custom scripts out there for animation. He keeps a **[blog](http://graphite9.com/blog/)** and updates his repertoire of tools often.

Have any other scripts or tools you can't live without that I didn't mention? Leave a comment below, I'm interested in learning other workflow ideas!

P.S. - Happy Labor Day!
