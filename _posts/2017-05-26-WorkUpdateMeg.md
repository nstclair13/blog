<h1 class="major">Work Update - Meg</h1>

Well, today was my last day on Spiderman: Homecoming. It also marks the end of my first lead animator role too. The project was relatively short - roughly 5 months for me - it was jam packed to the brim with all sorts of new challenges. I'm super proud of the work done by my team and fellow animators and I hope you all go see it in theaters! 


Starting tomorrow I'm on vacation for two weeks then will be returning to start a new project: **[Meg (2018)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4779682/)**


This is a new one for me as I've never really had the opportunity to animate underwater creatures let alone an enormous shark! I'll leave my reservations about the plot at the door...it looks like a lot of fun to work on though!
